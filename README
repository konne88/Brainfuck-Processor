Brainfuck-Processor
===================

The goal of this project is to create a processor able to execute Brainfuck.
Written in VHDL for a FPGA it is not suppost to interpret Brainfuck but to
actually execute it as bytecode, much like an Intel Processor executes Assembler.

Due to our noobness in hardware programming the code is neither nice, clean or working.
It is a pain to use memory if you have to build a state mashine to acces it.
But hardware people do know how to write documentation, maybe not good ones but
they are really really long and full of information.

All info available to us is checked in with the project.
